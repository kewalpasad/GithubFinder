The App shows github statistics of the searched user.

## Features:

1. search the Github User.
2. shows the image of the user.
3. Shows the details of 5 repos of each user
4. Gives an error message if the user is not found.


**_Screenshots_** are added in screenshots folder and each image is renamed according to the function performed on it.

_**BootSwatch**_ UI has been used to style the HTML.I have removed client key and client secret form the github.js for security purpose if you want you can register and get those from https://github.com/settings/applications/new . The entire project has been built on _**Vanilla Javascript**_ that is, no frameworks have been used. All The DOM manipulation and Document Selecting is done with Javascript. This project was built for learning purpose and is not intended to be used in any commercial project.

This Project has been taken from Brad Traversy's Modern JavaScript From The Beginning Course.
